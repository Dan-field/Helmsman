GameMaker 2D sailing mechanic

This is a fun project that I sort of got working to a demonstration level and then got sidetracked and haven't done anything for a couple of years. It is written in the GameMaker environment (www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker). It needs to be opened in Gamemaker to run.

As stated in the licensing file, I am releasing all of this into the public domain. If anyone wants to take any or all of it and do something, you are welcome to do so.

Happy coding!
